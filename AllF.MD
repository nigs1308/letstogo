Given an array A of integers, return the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in A.
Recall that a subsequence of A is a list A[i_1], A[i_2], ..., A[i_k] with 0 <= i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_k <= A.length - 1, and that a sequence B is arithmetic if B[i+1] - B[i] are all the same value (for 0 <= i < B.length - 1).

Example 1:

Input: [3,6,9,12]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The whole array is an arithmetic sequence with steps of length = 3.

Example 2:

Input: [9,4,7,2,10]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The longest arithmetic subsequence is [4,7,10].

Example 3:

Input: [20,1,15,3,10,5,8]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The longest arithmetic subsequence is [20,15,10,5].

```

```
class Solution {
    public int longestArithSeqLength(int[] A) {
        Map<Integer, Map<Integer, Integer>> dp = new HashMap<>();
        int res = 2;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < A.length; i ++){
            for(int j = i+1; j < A.length; j++){
                Map<Integer, Integer> m = dp.computeIfAbsent(A[j]-A[i], d->new HashMap<>());
                m.put(j, m.getOrDefault(i, 1) + 1);
                res = Math.max(res, m.get(j));
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}

Given a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.

Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

 

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: true
Explanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.

Example 2:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: false
Explanation: The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible.

```

```
class Solution {
    public boolean isCompleteTree(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null)
            return true;
        Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<TreeNode>();
        q.offer(root);
        
        boolean missing = false;
        while(!q.isEmpty()){
                TreeNode node = q.poll();
                if(node != null){
                    if(missing) return false;
                    q.offer(node.left);
                    q.offer(node.right);
                }else{
                    missing = true;
                }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
